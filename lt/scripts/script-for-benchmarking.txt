We're going to try an experiment to see how quickly the transcriber can work through simultaneous audio tracks. It's pretty unrealistic to have two people talking over one another for an extended period of time, since you can't understand what they're saying. But sometimes you'll have overlapping audio as someone interrupts a speaker.

April is the cruelest month, breeding Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring Dull roots with spring rain. Winter kept us warm, covering Earth in forgetful snow, feeding A little life with dried tubers. Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.

And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s, My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled, And I was frightened.

He said, Marie, Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. In the mountains, there you feel free.

I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man, You cannot say, or guess, for you know only

Only There is shadow under this red rock, (Come in under the shadow of this red rock), And I will show you something different from either Your shadow at morning striding behind you Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you; I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

And now for the poem said by one person in one long monologue to test how the audio gets windowed.

Ok, back to the regular transcript from a dev meeting, which we've cut up and assigned to different speakers. There is some crosstalk.

2s
Alice
Yeah, it should probably be a quick one. Just kind of a bit of a, maybe I'm missing something, maybe, well, maybe just, we have kind of a consensus on this in a while.

Alice
But basically, there's been a couple of times recently where I've merged people's PRs and they've come back to me and said, hey, I'd still had something else I wanted to do on that.

1s
Dartagnan
I do have a couple of thoughts, but I also don't want to buy us the discussion, so there's anyone else.

Bilbo
Let's talk over one another for a few sentences to see how the transcriber handles it. Or then it might merge in and then fail. That could be solved with a merge queue, but that's a whole other thing we need to configure.
Dartagnan
Usually you wouldn't have three people talking over one another like this. Seems a little crazy to me.

Cercei
Okay, well, I tend to think that way as well.
Bilbo
But that doesn't always work as we want. Sometimes there are maybe like last minute like additions or little fixes that the author wants.

1s
Cercei
That may be problematic. So I definitely acknowledge there is a potential problem there. But it's eventually is really about process.

I appreciate the invite. So I'm working on some tools on GitHub for making it possible to build large scale go applications in a more modular way.

300ms
Bilbo
I was working on LibPierre to Pierre, which is a go library for peer-to-peer communications. And we were talking about having a demon for it that you could configure.

300ms
Bilbo
The idea being, let's say I have a service on one machine and I want to access it somewhere else and I'd like to tunnel that communication over peer-to-peer network with sort of any protocol under the covers, whether it be WebRTC or Web Sockets.

300ms
Bilbo
And I was looking at how could we implement this demon for this? And the initial work was kind of a little bit annoying because when you're building something like that, you end up making all kinds of assumptions about how the code works underneath. And so I sort of set out to find a way to make this thing more modular.

2s
Alice
Amazing. That is incredibly interesting and I'm sure we're gonna find so many applications for this.
Bilbo
And hopefully here I can show my screen, let's see. Okay, I'll put this on the other one. All right, so now I don't know necessarily if you will find these tools useful or not.

Cercei
Let's talk about something else?

100ms
Bilbo
Yeah, it's not long that something I like to start gets kind of stuck for quite a few months. A long story short, this at the effort to make the source, make the metrics,

500ms
Dartagnan
Make the code for powering our permeasious metrics source available, which is to say that it's now in the public monorepo. Developers can see the code.
Cercei
There's a means by which developers can contribute to that code. They compile their local developer version with metrics and test that, do whatever they want with it. However, the team addition

1s
Alice
continues to ship without any metrics and there's nothing that can be done to flip that bit on at runtime. It's just not included in the code at all. So it's kind of the beginning of this new enterprise source available mindset, which I'd love to see more code live in this as opposed to.

500ms
Cercei
having to go into the closed source repository. And maybe someday, far into the future, you know, the enterprise closed source repository just lives in a source available folder and we call it a day. But just as an interesting anecdote, the biggest reason why this didn't get merged.

500ms
Bilbo
Was because I had written some end-to-end tests that were failing in CI and not failing locally. There's some weird flakiness around, you know, loading and unloading a license and, you know.
Alice
I figured maybe it was just bad, um, a code path that we hadn't fully tested.

500ms
Cercei
It turns out that in CI, at least as before I merged, the way we do license-based testing is there's an mm_license environment variable that, um, just, you know, exposure to the license to the.

100ms
Cercei
Available and puts it right back. Um, so all of my tests that were trying to remove it and prove that metrics got disabled, um, because in an enterprise edition just would fail in that mindset because

100ms
Alice
They never actually got disabled. So if anyone's writing any tests that involved licenses, right now, that is a limitation of the CI framework. Pretty sure, um, Saturn and, and the team are, are having on their queue to like go and figure out a different solution to that. But that was the, the hold-up for,

400ms
Bilbo
You know, why I didn't get merged quite so quickly. So I was hoping to figure out the source of that. Um, that also means that the test that is merged is actually still failing and we agree that.

200ms
Dartagnan
Was okay for now. Obviously if you see that, that's, that's my fault. Um, yeah. Anyway, just in case you're looking for metrics, they're in the honor repo and it's all merged and hopefully this is the the beginning of a new thing, that's it for me.

300ms
Dartagnan
Okay, I have one. I don't want to put you on your on the spot, just as so, feel free to say, I don't know, but can you just remind us what the source available license is, what it permits?

300ms
Alice
And do you know how it differs from something like a GPL or similarly open source license?

400ms
Bilbo
Right. So the matter most source available license is kind of, it's a handcrafted license that our legal team helped draft. It's inspired by how GitLab, GitLab, oh my goodness, GitLab

1s
Cercei
Distributes their enterprise source code, which is also in their motor repo, and essentially code that is licensed under the source available license, obviously the source is available,

300ms
Cercei
but to use it in a production environment, as to how the license is written, requires in our case a matter most enterprise addition license, a valid one. So that explicitly

300ms
Bilbo
Allows the use of that code in developer environments and in testing environments, just not in production. That's really the extent of it. We used in playbooks, that's where it kind of originated three years ago, to continue to develop in that single repository, mindset, and I think it's red to a full of other repositories as well.

1s
Dartagnan
Sort of thing, there's like no logic, no business logic there whatsoever. And as we all kind of understand that the purpose of these licenses isn't to prevent somebody from overriding it and then just using it as they see fit. It has much more to do with business and how
Alice
Businesses are willing to use products and code in various environments.

The end.
