Calls performance primarily depends on two resources: CPU and bandwidth (both network latency and overall throughput). The final consumption exhibits quadratic growth with the number of clients transmitting and receiving media.

As an example, a single call with 10 participants of which two are unmuted (transmitting voice data) will generally consume double the resources than the same call with a single participant unmuted. What ultimately counts towards performance is the overall number of concurrent media flows (in/out) across the server.
